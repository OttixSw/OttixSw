- 👋 Hi, I’m Matthew Costello
- I coined the name Ottix many years ago (I was ottix.uucp before I was ottix.com)
  and was a Systems Programmer working for one of the BUNCH. I've written programs
  in many programming languages, many of which no longer exist.
- My first micro-computer used the Motorola 6800 and started with 1K of static RAM and
  32 bytes of PROM. It was wire-wrapped on Vector cards that plugged into a hand-wired
  backplane.
- I’m interested in Home Automation. My home automation system is HAPY
  (Home Automation in PYthon) and replaced a Perl version in 2014. I've thought
  about replacing it with Home Assistant but probably never will ...
  HAPY's claim to fame is that it is self-describing; even value typing is value typed,
  those circular and self-references is something Python has real problems importing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about 3D printing.
  I bought a SnapMaker 3D Printer
  but it is waiting on a cabinet that is designed but I have not yet built.
  I finally have a social media account because SnapMaker does almost all support
  via several Facebook Groups.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Bluetooth, specifically with the ESPresense project.
  I've almost finished a Python version of the ESPresense program for Linux/BlueZ;
  it runs side-by-side with the ESP32 version.
  I'm also working on a esposition program to provide
  postion (x,y,z) and location (in room/area).
- 💞️ I’m also looking to collaborate on Z-Wave Soil Moisture Sensors. I want Soil Moisture sensors that
  I can use inside and outside and Z-Wave has great range (sub GHz frequency doesn't hurt) and
  very low power use. Z-Wave development no longer requires NDAs nor huge amounts of money.
  The only remaining issue is Z-Wave certification as that is not currently possible
  for individuals.
- I've released a fair amount of software into the public domain (mostly pre GPL).
  I will be releasing newer sofware here on github. I expect that 'espresense' and 'espositon'
  will be the first. HAPY has been going through a major rewrite and will not be ready until 2024.
- 📫 I can be reached via email and on Facebook.
